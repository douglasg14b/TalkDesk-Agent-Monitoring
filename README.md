# TalkDesk Real Time Pause States

This is a small user script I created to be used within my organization to display TalkDesk pause states in real time. Just copy/paste the UserScript.js contents into your chrome console.

### Filtering
To filter out values, click on settings and go to the "Hide Matching" box. Type in anything you want filtered in there. 

To filter multiple values, deliminate your text with a `|`. ie. `name1 | name2`
